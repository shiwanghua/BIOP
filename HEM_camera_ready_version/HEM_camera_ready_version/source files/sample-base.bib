abstract = {The content-based publish/subscribe system is a flexible many-to-many communication middleware that meets the demands of many large-scale distributed applications. It is well known that event matching is a fundamental component of the content-based publish/subscribe system. When designing matching algorithms, matching speed is a major objective being pursued. Moreover, through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, we discover that the matching speed of most existing matching algorithms is affected by the subscriptions’ matchability which is defined as the matching probability of subscriptions with events. Nevertheless, this problem has not been considered in existing matching algorithms. To address this problem, we propose REIN (REctangle INtersection), a fast and anti-matchability matching algorithm for content-based publish/subscribe systems. REIN is a fast matching algorithm, following the conventional design objective of pursuing a high matching speed. Furthermore, due to the utilization of a negative searching strategy that aims to filter out unmatching subscriptions in the matching process, the matching speed of REIN is not affected by the subscriptions’ matchability, but rather is improved. To evaluate the performance of REIN, comprehensive experiments are conducted. The experiment results show that REIN not only has an excellent matching performance, but also possesses a beneficial anti-matchability feature.}

BPEL processes are currently executed by a centralized orchestration engine, in which issues such as scalability, platform heterogeneity, and division across administrative domains can be difficult to manage. We propose a distributed agent-based orchestration engine in which several lightweight agents execute a portion of the original business process and collaborate in order to execute the complete process. The complete set of standard BPEL activities are supported, and the transformations of several BPEL activities to the agent-based architecture are described. Evaluations of an implementation of this architecture demonstrate that agent-based execution scales better than a non-distributed approach, with at least 70% and 120% improvements in process execution time, and throughput, respectively, even with a large number of concurrent process instances. In addition, the distributed architecture successfully executes large processes that are shown to be infeasible to execute with a nondistributed engine.},

A virtually synchronous environment allows processes to be structured into process groups, and makes events like broadcasts to the group as an entity, group membership changes, and even migration of an activity from one place to another appear to occur instantaneously — in other words, synchronously. A major advantage to this approach is that many aspects of a distributed application can be treated independently without compromising correctness. Moreover, user code that is designed as if the system were synchronous can often be executed concurrently. We argue that this approach to building distributed and fault-tolerant software is more straightforward, more flexible, and more likely to yield correct solutions than alternative approaches.},

abstract = {We address the problem of supporting a large number of select-join subscriptions for wide-area publish/subscribe. Subscriptions are joins over different tables, with varying interests expressed as range selection conditions over table attributes. Naive schemes, such as computing and sending join results from a server, are inefficient because they produce redundant data, and are unable to share dissemination costs across subscribers and events. We propose a novel, scalable scheme that group-processes and disseminates a general mix of multi-way select-join subscriptions. We also propose a simple and application-agnostic extension to content-driven networks (CN), which further improves sharing of dissemination costs. Experimental evaluations show that our schemes can generate orders of magnitude lower network traffic at very low processing cost. Our extension to CN can further reduce traffic by another order of magnitude, with almost no increase in notification latency.},

In this paper, we present three different pub/sub-driven designs for a MMOG networking engine that account for the highly interactive and massive nature of these games. Each design uses not only different pub/sub approaches (from topic-based to content-based) but also serves varying degrees of responsibilities. In particular, some of them integrate game functionality, such as interest management, into the network engine. We implement, evaluate, and compare our proposed designs in the MMOG prototype Mammoth. Our real-world results show the viability of pub/sub while at the same time highlighting clear trade-offs between the different designs used, especially in the number and frequency of the various message types, such as subscriptions.},

abstract = {Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems are designed to efficiently match incoming events (e.g., stock quotes) against a set of subscriptions (e.g., trader profiles specifying quotes of interest). However, current pub/sub systems only support a simple binary notion of matching: an event either matches a subscription or it does not; for instance, a stock quote will either match or not match a trader profile. In this paper, we argue that this simple notion of matching is inadequate for many applications where only the "best" matching subscriptions are of interest. For instance, in targeted Web advertising, an incoming user ("event") may match several different advertiser-specified user profiles ("subscriptions"), but given the limited advertising real-estate, we want to quickly discover the best (e.g., most relevant) ads to display.To address this need, we initiate a study of ranked pub/sub systems. We focus on the case where subscriptions correspond to interval ranges (e.g, age in [25,35] and salary &gt; $50, 000), and events are points that match all the intervals that they stab (e.g., age=28, salary = $65,000). In addition, each interval has a score and our goal is to quickly recover the top-scoring matching subscriptions. Unfortunately, adapting existing index structures to solve this problem results in either an unacceptable space overhead or a significant performance degradation. We thus propose two novel index structures that are both compact and efficient. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed structures provide a scalable basis for designing ranked pub/sub systems.},
